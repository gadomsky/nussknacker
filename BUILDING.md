Building Nussknacker
====================

Note
----
All build instructions should work on Linux and (probably) on Mac. Currently we don't support Windows.

sbt
---
We use sbt 0.13.7 at the moment. If you don't want to install it locally you can use provided ./sbtwrapper script
npm
---
To build frontend parts, you have to have npm installed\n
